# Infra  :cyclone:  
 Infra is an open source infrastructure management actions automation data and tools. 
 Our goal is to implement in an efficient manner datacenter's operations with continuous 
 velocity and end-user quality improvement. Each datacenter operations is a triplet of {Input, ParametricActionFunction, Output} 
 
 - Input :arrow_right: ParametricActionFunction_{Quality, Velocity} :arrow_right: Output 
 - Extreme programming pair : One implement and test Other apply on real concrete case.  
 - Each ParametricActionFunction is reversible. 

Quality is the perception of the user when he use the triplet and show that the result is stable clean reliable and reproductible.
